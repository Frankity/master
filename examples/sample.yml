# Sample configuration for defining game headers.
# Headers should be double quoted (") and not single quoted (')
#
precedence: true|false              # Used for games that use the same engine.
                                    # eg, Quake 2 has precidence over all other idtech2 games
                                    # If they do not differentiate themselves
engine: idtech2                     # (Optional) Which iD engine the game uses
encoding: latin1                    # (Optional) Which encoding to use when decoding bytes
                                    # 'latin1' is default.
game: quake2                        # The name of the game
active: true|false                  # Whether or not these headers should be loaded
server:                             # Headers that a server will send to a master server
                                    # All named headers - eg, ping assume the server is 'active'
                                    # At the time of writing 'shutdown' header is assumed to set
                                    # server as 'inactive'
  ping:
    recv: "\xff\xff\xff\xffping"    # The header that the master server will recieve 
    resp: "\xff\xff\xff\xffack"     # (Optional) The header that the master server will return
  shutdown:
    recv: "\xff\xff\xff\xffshutdown"

client:                             # Headers that a client will send to a master server
  query:
    recv: "query"                   # The header that the master server will recieve
    resp: "\xff\xff\xff\xffservers" # (Optional) The header that the master server will return
