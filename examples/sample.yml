# Sample configuration for defining game headers.
# Headers are base64 encoded binary
# yaml.dump(b'\xff\xff\xff\xffping') ~= !!binary /////3Bpbmc=
#
precedence: true|false              # Used for games that use the same engine.
                                    # eg, Quake 2 has precidence over all other idtech2 games
                                    # If they do not differentiate themselves
engine: idtech2                     # (Optional) Which iD engine the game uses
encoding: latin1                    # (Optional) Which encoding to use when decoding bytes
